1 Hour, 
I was itching to play a game of League, but I realized that my keyboard was downstairs, and my lazy bum did not want to get out of my room. So that gave me the idea of making a League of Legnds ability macropad. I started looking at the Hackclub guide information on the night of the 27th, I downloaded kicad and went to bed.
